This project contains a partial sample configuration for building a fully functional Funtoo image from a stage 3 tarball in an automated and consistent manner (and allow relatively painless migration from one flavor of Linux to another).

Due to the sheer number of patches for my systems, it is unlikely a full release will be published.

This configuration is based off of a storage variant from 2018/07/20 which provides an iSCSI service.
This system configuration doesn't do anything else other than storage, so it is a good reference system to illustrate capabilities of the linux-builder application (which also supports Ubuntu, Debian, and Gentoo, provided the patches are tweaked for the right paths / application names, FreeBSD support is in the works)


In order to "build" this image, the linux-builder/modules/cli/providers/guice must be built and run via java -jar.
